# SWAT4HCLS hackathon

## Bioschemas
During the hackathon Leyla Garcia wrote a Shape Expression to validate a [bioschema header](./ProteinEntity-with-context.shex). The ShEx file captured in this GitHub repo is a copy. The original lives in the [bioschemas repository](https://github.com/BioSchemas/specifications/tree/master/Protein).

## BYOD ShExathon
[ShEx Online Validator](http://rawgit.com/shexSpec/shex.js/wikidata/doc/shex-simple.html?#) is a ShEx validator build on top of the ShEx.js implementation. The pre-SWAT4HCLS implemantation lacked a feasture to store the results. During the hackathon a feature was added to the ShEx onoline validator to downlaod the ShEx results in json for downstream processing.
