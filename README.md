## Bioschemas
During the hackathon Leyla Garcia wrote a Shape Expression to validate a [bioschema header](./ProteinEntity-with-context.shex). The ShEx file captured in this GitHub repo is a copy. The original lives in the [bioschemas repository](https://github.com/BioSchemas/specifications/tree/master/Protein).
